//If you can't understand my code watch MP4 (not loop unroling)(Maybe because there is too little data, updating the intermediate value in game will be slower)
-------------------
//Although this is indeed faster than Insertion Sort, it doesn't seem to be faster than other sorting? But I still want to know if anyone has thought of this in the past If anyone knows please tell me

XXXXXX <-----Input

XXXXXXXXXXXX <--------Sort Add=Input*2

XXXXX(X)XXXXXX <------Sort Add[Input MAX]

if Input>(X) Sort Add[]<----Insertion Sort() 

if Input<(X) Insertion Sort()---->Sort Add[] 

New (X)=(Insertion Sort Low+Hgih)/2

Loop
