//If you can't understand my code watch MP4 (not loop unroling)(Maybe because there is too little data, updating the intermediate value in game will be slower)

//Because I was banned by Reddit Shadow ban, I wrote this here. If you still don't understand after watching the video, I suggest that some people in r/algorithms should not think that they understand programming. After all, they don't even understand the basic operation of computers.(According to the most supportive remarks, you donâ€™t understand the person who wrote the code for the first time. It's really incredible)

//But thank for other normal reply in the post (although there is no actual answer ...What I want to know is obviously that this algorithm has thought of in the past)

//Sort--------------------------------

XXXXXX <-----Input

XXXXXXXXXXXX <--------Sort Add=Input*2

XXXXX(X)XXXXXX <------Sort Add[Input MAX]

if Input>(X) Sort Add[]<----Insertion Sort() 

if Input<(X) Insertion Sort()---->Sort Add[] 

New (X)=(Insertion Sort Low+Hgih)/2

Loop
