//Because I was banned by Reddit Shadow, I wrote this here. If you still don't understand after watching the video, I suggest that some people in r/algorithms should not think that they understand programming. After all, they don't even understand the basic operation of computers.

XXXXXX <-----Input

XXXXXXXXXXXX <--------Sort Add=Input*2

XXXXX(X)XXXXXX <------Sort Add[Input MAX]

if Input>(X) Sort Add[]<----Insertion Sort() 

if Input<(X) Insertion Sort()---->Sort Add[] 

New (X)=(Insertion Sort Low+Hgih)/2

Loop
